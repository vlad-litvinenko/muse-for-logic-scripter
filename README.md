# The Triadex Muse algorithm for Logic Pro X Scripter plug-in.

Originally implemented by J. Donald Tillman and used with his kind permission.
You'll find emulation, extensive explanation and links to the Muse manuals at Donald's website: http://www.till.com/articles/muse

The actual Muse was invented in 1969 by Marvin Minsky and Edward Fredkin at MIT.

### Usage
1. Load Scripter MIDI Plug-In
2. Open Script Editor
3. Copy and paste the code
4. Click RunScript button

Multiple instances of the Scripter can be loaded to the same track allowing polifony.

If you're using multi-timbral instrument, you can route different instances of the script to different
channels with Cannel setting.

Because this version is tempo synced and controlled by DAW transport, controls such as start/hold/tempo are not present.
